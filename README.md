this is my login form i coded its not interactive just all html and css
it took me forever to push it to github because i made it on windows and my dev enviroment uses WSL2 and it took me foever to move the project from windows
to the subsystem. first time for everything i guess lol but yeah took a while to move the directory into my repo that i cloned from github but got that done too.
so here it is just a super basic login form all this stuff might seem easy to you but its a hell of a roller coaster ride for me anyway enjoy and wish me luck on my journey <3
